def dl_model():
    """
    This function creates a deep learning model for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset.
    
    The model begins by compressing the input features with global average pooling to capture global information from the feature map.
    It then utilizes two fully connected layers to generate weights whose size is the same as the channels of the input, learning the correlations among the feature map's channels.
    These weights are reshaped to align with the input shape and multiplied element-wise with the input feature map.
    Finally, the output is produced by flattening the result and passing it through another fully connected layer to obtain the final probability distribution.
    
    Args:
    None
    
    Returns:
    A compiled Keras model
