def dl_model():
    """
    This function constructs a deep learning model for image classification using Functional APIs of Keras.
    
    The model is designed to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. It consists of a main path and a branch path.
    
    The main path processes the input through a 1x1 convolutional layer, then splits into three branches.
    The first branch extracts local features through a 3x3 convolutional layer.
    The second and third branches downsample the input through average pooling layers, process the downsampled data through 3x3 convolutional layers, and then upsample it through transpose convolutional layers.
    
    The outputs of all branches are concatenated, and a 1x1 convolutional layer is applied to form the main path output.
    
    The branch path processes the input through a 1x1 convolutional layer to match the number of channels of the main path.
    
    Finally, the main path and branch path outputs are fused together through addition.
    
    The final output is completed through a fully connected layer for 10-class classification.
