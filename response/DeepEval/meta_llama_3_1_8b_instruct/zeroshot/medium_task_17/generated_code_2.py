    This function constructs a deep learning model for image classification using the Functional API of Keras.
    The model starts by reshaping the input tensor into three groups, then swaps the third and fourth dimensions using a permutation operation.
    Finally, the output is passed through a fully connected layer with a softmax activation for classification.

    Returns:
        A constructed Keras model.
