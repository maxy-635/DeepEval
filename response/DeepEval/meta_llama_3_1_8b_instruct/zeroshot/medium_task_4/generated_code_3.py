    This function creates a deep learning model for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset.
    
    The model features two pathways that combine to create a comprehensive feature representation through addition:
    path1 consists of two blocks of convolution followed by average pooling, which progressively extracts deep features from the images.
    Path2 employs a single convolutional layer to process the input.
    
    After feature extraction, the outputs from both pathways are flattened into a one-dimensional vector.
    This vector is then mapped to a probability distribution over the 10 classes using a fully connected layer.
