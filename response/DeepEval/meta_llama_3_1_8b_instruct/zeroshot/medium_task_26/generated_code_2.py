def dl_model():
    """
    This function constructs a deep learning model for image classification.
    
    The model begins by compressing the input channels with a 1x1 convolutional layer.
    It then expands the features through two parallel convolutional layers, applying 1x1 and 3x3 convolutions, and concatenates the results.
    Finally, the output feature map is flattened into a one-dimensional vector and passed through two fully connected layers to produce the classification results.
    
    Parameters:
    None
    
    Returns:
    model: A Keras model instance.
