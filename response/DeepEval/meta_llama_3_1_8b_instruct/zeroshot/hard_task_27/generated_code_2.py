def dl_model():
    """
    This function constructs a deep learning model for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset.
    
    The model begins by extracting spatial features with a 7x7 depthwise separable convolutional layer, 
    incorporating layer normalization to enhance training stability. It then passes through two fully connected 
    layers with the same number of channels as the input layer for channel-wise feature transformation. 
    Finally, the model combines the original input with the processed features through an addition operation. 
    The output classifies the images into 10 categories using the final two fully connected layers.
    
    Parameters:
    None
    
    Returns:
    model (keras.Model): The constructed deep learning model.
