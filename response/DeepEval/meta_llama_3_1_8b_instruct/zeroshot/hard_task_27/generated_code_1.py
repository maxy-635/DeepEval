def dl_model():
    """
    Construct a deep learning model for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset.
    
    The model begins with a 7x7 depthwise separable convolutional layer, incorporating layer normalization 
    to enhance training stability. It then passes through two fully connected layers with the same numbers 
    of channels as the input layer for channel-wise feature transformation. Finally, the model combines the 
    original input with the processed features through an addition operation. The output classifies the images 
    into 10 categories using the final two fully connected layers.
    
    Args:
        None
    
    Returns:
        A constructed Keras model.
