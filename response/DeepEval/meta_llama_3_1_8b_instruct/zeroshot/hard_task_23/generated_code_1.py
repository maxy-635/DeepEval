    This function constructs a deep learning model for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset.
    The model consists of a 1x1 initial convolutional layer, three distinct branches for local feature extraction, 
    downsampling and upsampling, and finally a fully connected layer for classification.
    
    Parameters:
    None
    
    Returns:
    A constructed Keras model instance.
