def dl_model():
    """
    This function constructs a deep learning model using Keras for image classification
    on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model first generates attention weights, reduces 
    dimensionality, and restores it before adding the processed output to the original 
    input image. Finally, it produces classification results through a flattened layer 
    and a fully connected layer.

    Returns:
        A constructed Keras model for image classification.
