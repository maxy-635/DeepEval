    This function constructs a deep learning model for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset.
    
    The model first generates attention weights with a 1x1 convolution followed by a softmax layer. 
    These weights are then multiplied with the input features to obtain contextual information through weighted processing.
    
    Next, the model reduces the input dimensionality to one-third of its original size using another 1x1 convolution,
    followed by layer normalization and ReLU activation. The dimensionality is then restored with an additional 1x1 convolution.
    
    The processed output is added to the original input image. Finally, a flattened layer and a fully connected layer produce the classification results.
