    This function constructs a deep learning model using Keras' Functional API for image classification.
    
    The model architecture includes:
    1. Convolutional layer
    2. Batch normalization
    3. ReLU activation
    4. Global average pooling
    5. Two fully connected layers
    6. Reshaping and multiplying with initial features
    7. Concatenating with the input layer
    8. 1x1 convolution and average pooling for dimensionality reduction
    9. Single fully connected layer for output
