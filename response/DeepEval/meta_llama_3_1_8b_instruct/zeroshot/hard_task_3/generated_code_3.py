def dl_model():
    """
    Creates a deep learning model for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset.
    
    The model splits the input into three groups along the channel dimension, 
    then processes each group through a sequence of 1x1 convolution and 3x3 convolution 
    layers for feature extraction, followed by a dropout layer to mitigate overfitting. 
    The outputs from the three groups are concatenated to form the main pathway. 
    In parallel, a branch pathway processes the input through a 1x1 convolution 
    to match the output dimension of the main pathway. The outputs from both pathways 
    are combined using an addition operation. Finally, the resulting output is passed 
    through a fully connected layer to complete the classification process.
    
    Returns:
    A Keras model instance.
