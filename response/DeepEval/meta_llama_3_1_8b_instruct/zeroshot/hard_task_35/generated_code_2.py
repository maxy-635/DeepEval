    This function generates a deep learning model for image classification 
    using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model features two branches, each 
    incorporating a same block. The block first applies global average 
    pooling to compress the input features and then passes the pooled 
    output through two fully connected layers to produce weights whose 
    dimension is equal to the channel of input. These weights are reshaped 
    to match the input's shape and are then element-wise multiplied with 
    the block's input. The outputs from both branches are concatenated, 
    followed by a flattening layer and a fully connected layer, which 
    ultimately yields the classification results.
