    This function generates a deep learning model for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset.
    The model features two branches, each incorporating a same block. The block first applies global average pooling 
    to compress the input features and then passes the pooled output through two fully connected layers to produce 
    weights whose dimension is equal to the channel of input. These weights are reshaped to match the input's shape 
    and are then element-wise multiplied with the block's input. The outputs from both branches are concatenated, 
    followed by a flattening layer and a fully connected layer, which ultimately yields the classification results.
