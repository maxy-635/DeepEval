def dl_model():
    """
    This function constructs a deep learning model for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset.
    
    The model consists of a main path and a branch path. The main path begins with a 7x7 depthwise convolution 
    to extract features, followed by layer normalization for standardization. Next, it includes two sequential 
    1x1 pointwise convolution layers with the same numbers of channel as the input layer to refine the feature 
    representation. The branch path connects directly to the input. The outputs of both paths are then combined 
    through an addition operation. Finally, the combined output is flattened into a one-dimensional vector and 
    processed through two fully connected layers for classification.
    
    Parameters:
    None
    
    Returns:
    A compiled Keras model
