    Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence.

    The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows:
    start with any positive integer n.
    Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows:
    - if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term.
    - if the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.

    The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.

    Note:
    - Collatz(1) is [1].
    - returned list sorted in increasing order.

    Args:
      n: A positive integer.

    Returns:
      A sorted list that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence.
