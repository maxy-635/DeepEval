def method():
    """
    This function checks if it is possible to concatenate two strings in some order, 
    that the resulting string will be good. A string S is considered to be good if 
    and only if all parentheses in S are balanced.

    Args:
    str1 (str): The first string consisting of open parentheses '(' or close parentheses ')'.
    str2 (str): The second string consisting of open parentheses '(' or close parentheses ')'.

    Returns:
    bool: True if it is possible to concatenate the two strings in some order, 
          that the resulting string will be good, False otherwise.
