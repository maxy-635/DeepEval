    Given an array representing a branch of a tree that has non-negative integer nodes 
    your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it. The plucked node should be the 
    node with the smallest even value. If multiple nodes with the same smallest even value 
    are found return the node that has smallest index. The plucked node should be returned 
    in a list, [smallest_value, its index]. If there are no even values or the given array 
    is empty, return [].

        list: A list containing the smallest even value and its index. If there are no even 
        values or the given array is empty, return an empty list.
