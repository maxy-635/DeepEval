    Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic.
    
    A palindromic array is an array that is read the same backwards and forwards. In one change, you can change one element to any other element.

    Args:
        arr (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
        int: The minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic.
