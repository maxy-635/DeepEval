Requirement: "I would like assistance in creating a deep learning model for image 
  classification using the MNIST dataset. The model will start with an average pooling
  layer that utilizes a 5x5 window and a 3x3 stride for feature dimensionality reduction.
  This is followed by a 1x1 convolutional layer,which enhances the depth and introduces 
  nonlinearity to the feature maps. The feature maps are then flattened and passed through
  two fully connected layers for additional feature processing. To mitigate the risk of 
  overfitting, a dropout layer is included between these fully connected layers. Finally, 
  the output from the second fully connected layer will produce a probability distribution
  across 10 classes, suitable for multi-class classification."
