Requirement: "Please assist me in creating a deep learning model for image classification
  using the MNIST dataset. The model will extract features through two sequential blocks:
  the first consists of three convolutional layers followed by max pooling, and the second
  consists of four convolutional layers followed by max pooling. After the feature extraction,
  the feature maps will be flattened and fed into three fully connected layers, culminating 
  in the classification output."
