Requirement: "Please assist me in creating a deep learning model for image classification
  using the MNIST dataset. The model begins with a depthwise separable convolutional 
  layer to process the input data, followed by a 1x1 convolutional layer for feature 
  extraction. To mitigate overfitting, a dropout layer is added after each convolutional
  layer. Finally, the output is flattened and passed through a fully connected layer to 
  generate classification probabilities."
