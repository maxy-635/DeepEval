Requirement: "Please assist me in creating a deep learning model for image classification
  using the MNIST dataset. The model features a specialized block designed to capture 
  local features through a 3x3 convolutional layer, followed by two 1x1 convolutional 
  layers for additional processing. An average pooling layer is then applied to downsample
  the feature maps, and a dropout layer is included to mitigate overfitting. After two 
  consecutive the blocks, a global average pooling layer converts the high-dimensional 
  feature maps into a one-dimensional vector.This is followed by a flattening layer and
  a fully connected layer that produces the final classification output."
