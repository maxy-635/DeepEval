Requirement:  "Please help me create a deep learning model for image classification 
  using the MNIST dataset. The model begins with a 1x1 convolutional layer to increase
  dimensionality, followed by a 3x3 depthwise separable convolutional layer for feature
  extraction. It then uses another 1x1 convolutional layer to reduce dimensionality, 
  with a stride of 2 applied to all convolutional layers. Finally,the model outputs 
  classification probabilities through a flattening layer and a fully connected layer."
