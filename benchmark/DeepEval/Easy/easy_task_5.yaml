Requirement: "Please assist me in creating a deep learning model for image classification 
  using the MNIST dataset. The model will first reduce the input dimensionality
  with a 1x1 convolution, then extract features using a 3x3 convolutional layer. It
  will restore the dimensionality of the feature map with another 1x1 convolution
  layer, followed by flattening the output. Finally, the flattened output will be
  fed into a fully connected layer with 10 neurons for classification, producing the
  final output."
