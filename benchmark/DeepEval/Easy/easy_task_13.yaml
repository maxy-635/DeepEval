Requirement: "I need assistance in creating a deep learning model for image 
  classification using the MNIST dataset. The model will consist of the following 
  layers: two 1x1 convolutional layers, followed by a 3x1 convolutional layer, and 
  a 1x3 convolutional layer. The number of channels will be restored to match the 
  input's channel count using another 1x1 convolutional layer. To mitigate overfitting,
  each convolutional layer will include a dropout layer. The processed features will 
  be combined with the original input via addition. Finally, the model will include a
  flattening layer followed by a fully connected layer to produce the final probability distribution."
