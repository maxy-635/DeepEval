Requirement: "Please help me generate a deep learning model for image classification. 
  The input data set is: MNIST.The model first extracts features through two <convolution,
  convolution, max pooling> blocks, followed by two <convolution,convolution, convolution,
  max pooling> blocks to further refine the features. Finally,the feature maps will be 
  flattened and passed through three fully connected layers to produce the classification results."
