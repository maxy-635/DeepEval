Requirement: "Please help me create a deep learning model for image classification 
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model begins by compressing the input features with 
  global average pooling to capture global information from the feature map. It then
  utilizes two fully connected layers to generate weights whose size is the same as 
  the channels of the input, learning the correlations among the feature map's channels.
  These weights are reshaped to align with the input shape and multiplied element-wise 
  with the input feature map. Finally, the output is produced by flattening the result 
  and passing it through another fully connected layer to obtain the final probability 
  distribution."
