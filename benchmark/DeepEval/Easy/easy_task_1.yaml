Requirement: "Please assist me in creating a deep learning model for image classification
  using the MNIST dataset. The model should start with two sequential layers comprising 
  a convolutional layer followed by a max pooling layer, followed by an additional 
  convolutional layer. After these layers, the feature maps will be flattened into a 
  one-dimensional vector. This vector will then be processed by two fully connected 
  layers to produce the final classification results."
