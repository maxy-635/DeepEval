Requirement: "I need assistance in creating a deep learning model for image classification 
  using the MNIST dataset. The model consists of a main path and a branch path. In the main
  path, the input first passes through two <convolution,dropout> blocks to gradually increase
  the feature width. This is followed by another convolutional layer to restore the number of
  channels. The branch path connects directly to the input. The outputs from both paths are 
  combined through an addition operation. Finally,a flattening layer and a fully connected 
  layer produce the final classification probabilities."
