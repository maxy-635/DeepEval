Requirement: "Please assist me in creating a deep learning model for image classification
  using the MNIST dataset. The model consists of two paths. In the main path, the first 
  convolutional layer increases the feature map width, followed by another convolutional 
  layer that restores the number of channels. The branch path directly connects to the 
  input. These two paths are then combined through an addition operation. Finally, a 
  flattened layer and a fully connected layer produce the final classification results."
