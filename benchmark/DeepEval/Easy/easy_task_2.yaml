Requirement: "Please assist me in creating a deep learning model for image classification. 
  The input data shape is 224x224x3. The model will include two sequential feature 
  extraction layers, each consisting of a convolutional layer followed by average 
  pooling. This is followed by three additional convolutional layers and another
  average pooling layer to reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps. After flattening
  the feature maps, the model will process them through two fully connected layers,
  each accompanied by a dropout layer to mitigate overfitting. Finally, the model
  will output classification probabilities via a softmax layer with 1,000 neurons."
