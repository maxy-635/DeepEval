Requirement: "Please assist me in creating a deep learning model for image classification
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model consists of four parallel convolutional paths: 
  the first path utilizes a 1x1 convolution, the second path features two 3x3 convolutions
  stacked after a 1x1 convolution, the third path includes a single 3x3 convolution following 
  a 1x1 convolution, and the fourth path starts with max pooling followed by a 1x1 convolution.
  The outputs from these paths are concatenated, flattened, and passed through a dense layer
  with 128 units before reaching the final output layer, which uses softmax activation to classify
  the input into one of 10 categories."
