Requirement: "Please assist me in creating a deep learning model for image classification
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model will include three max pooling layers with varying
  window sizes to extract features. The pooling windows will be 1x1, 2x2, and 4x4, with the
  stride set equal to the size of the respective pooling window. The output from each pooling
  layer will be flattened into a one-dimensional vector, and these vectors will be concatenated
  to form a unified feature set. Finally, the combined features will be fed into two fully 
  connected layers to produce classification results for the 10 classes."
