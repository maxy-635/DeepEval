Requirement: "Please help me generate a deep learning model for image classification. 
  The input data set is: CIFAR-10.This model employs a multi-branch convolutional structure.
  Specifically, Path 1 uses a single 1x1 convolution, Path2 uses a 1x1 convolution followed 
  by 1x7 and 7x1 convolutions, Path 3 uses a 1x1 convolution followed by a combination of 
  two sets of 1x7 and 7x1 convolutions to capture multi-directional spatial features, and 
  Path 4 uses average pooling followed by a 1x1 convolution. The outputs of these paths are
  then fused together through concatenation. Finally, the output is flattened into a 
  one-dimensional vector, which is then passed through a fully connected layer for classification."
