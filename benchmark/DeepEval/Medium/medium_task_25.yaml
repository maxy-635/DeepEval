Requirement: "Please help me generate a deep learning model for image classification. 
  The input data set is: CIFAR-10.The model extracts multi-scale and multi-directional 
  features from the input through four parallel branches. Specifically, Path 1 uses a 
  single 1x1 convolution, Path 2 uses average pooling followed by a 1x1 convolution, 
  Path 3 uses a 1x1 convolution followed by two parallel 1x3 and 3x1 convolutions and 
  concatenates the results, and Path 4 uses a 1x1 convolution followed by a 3x3 convolution,
  then followed by two parallel 1x3 and 3x1 convolutions and concatenates the results. 
  The outputs of these paths are finally concatenated together to form a multi-scale feature
  fusion. A fully connected layer is used for classification, outputting the classification 
  probabilities."
