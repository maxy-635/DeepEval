Requirement: "Please help me create a deep learning model for image classification
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model employs two stages of convolution and max
  pooling for downsampling, enabling multi-level feature extraction.These features
  are then processed through additional convolutional and dropout layers. To restore
  spatial information, the model integrates two sets of convolutions with upsampling
  using skip connections to the corresponding convolutional layers. Finally, it produces
  probability outputs for 10 categories through a 1x1 convolutional layer."
