Requirement: "Please help me generate a deep learning model for image classification. 
  The input data set is: CIFAR-10.The model achieves feature extraction and classification
  through three parts: Firstly, the input sequentially passes through 3 pairs of <convolutional
  layer, max-pooling layer> to extract deep features; Secondly, it undergoes processing through
  <convolutional layer, Dropout layer, convolutional layer> to enhance generalization capabilities;
  Then, it undergoes upsampling through 3 pairs of <convolutional layer, transposed convolutional 
  layer>, with skip connections to the corresponding convolutional layers in the first part, gradually restoring spatial information. Finally, a 1x1 convolutional layer generates a probability
  output for 10 classes."
