Requirement: "Please assist me in creating a deep learning model for image classification 
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model starts with an initial convolution, followed by 
  three parallel blocks. Each block consists of a convolutional layer, batch normalization,
  and ReLU activation. The outputs of these blocks are added with the initial convolution's
  output to enhance feature representation. Finally, the added output is flattened, passed 
  through fully connected layers, and classified using a Softmax output."
