Requirement: "Please assist me in creating a deep learning model for image classification 
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset.The model begins by defining a basic block, which comprises
  a convolutional layer, batch normalization, and ReLU activation as its main path. The 
  block's branch connects directly to the input. Feature fusion occurs by adding the outputs
  from both paths. An initial convolutional layer reduces the dimensionality of the input 
  features to 16. The main structure of the model consists of two consecutive basic blocks,
  while the branch extracts features via another convolutional layer. The outputs from both
  paths are combined again through addition, enhancing feature representation. Finally, an 
  average pooling layer downsamples the feature map, which is then flattened and processed 
  through a fully connected layer to produce the output for the classification task."
