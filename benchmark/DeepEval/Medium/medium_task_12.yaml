Requirement: "Please assist me in creating a deep learning model for image classification 
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model will comprise three blocks, each containing 
  convolutional operations, batch normalization, and a ReLU activation function. 
  The output of each block will be concatenated with the output from the previous 
  block along the channel dimension, serving as the input for the next block. Finally,
  the output will be flattened and passed through two fully connected layers to generate
  classification probabilities."
