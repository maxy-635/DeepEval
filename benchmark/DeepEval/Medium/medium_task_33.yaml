Requirement: "Please assist me in creating a deep learning model for image classification
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model will process the input image by splitting it into
  three channel groups by encapsulating tf.split within Lambda layer. Each group will undergo
  feature extraction through separable convolutional layers of varying sizes (1x1, 3x3, and 5x5).
  The outputs from these three groups will be concatenated and then passed through three fully
  connected layer to produce the final probability outputs."
