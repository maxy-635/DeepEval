Requirement: "I need assistance in creating a deep learning model for image classification
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model features a multi-branch convolutional architecture
  that processes input features at various scales using different convolutional kernel sizes
  and pooling. Specifically, it includes three branches: one with 3x3 convolutions, another 
  with 1x1 convolutions followed by two 3x3 convolutions, and a third employing max pooling.
  The outputs from these branches are concatenated to create a multi-scale feature fusion block.
  These fused feature maps are then flattened into a one-dimensional vector and passed through
  two fully connected layers for classification."
