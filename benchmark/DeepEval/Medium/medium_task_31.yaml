Requirement: "Please assist me in creating a deep learning model for image classification
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model will process the input image by splitting it into
  three groups along the channel dimension by encapsulating tf.split within Lambda layer. 
  Each group will apply different convolutional kernels: 1x1, 3x3, and 5x5, for multi-scale
  feature extraction. The outputs from these threegroups will be concatenated to fuse the 
  features. Finally, the fused features will be flattened into a one-dimensional vector and
  passed through two fully connected layers for classification."
