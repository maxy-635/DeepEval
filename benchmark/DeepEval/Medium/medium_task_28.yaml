Requirement: "I would like assistance in creating a deep learning model for image 
  classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model will first generate
  attention weights with a 1x1 convolution followed by a softmax layer. These weights
  will then be multiplied with the input features to obtain contextual information
  through weighted processing. Next, the model will reduce the input dimensionality
  to one-third of its original size using another 1x1 convolution,followed by layer
  normalization and ReLU activation. The dimensionality will then be restored with
  an additional 1x1 convolution. The processed output will be added to the original
  input image. Finally, a flattened layer and a fully connected layer will produce
  the classification results."
