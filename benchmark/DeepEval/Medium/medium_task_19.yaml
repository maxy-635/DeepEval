Requirement: "Please help me generate a deep learning model for image classification. 
  The input data set is: CIFAR-10.The model consists of four branches. The first branch
  uses a 1x1 convolution for dimensionality reduction; the second branch extracts features
  by first applying a 1x1 convolution followed by a 3x3 convolution; the third branch 
  captures larger spatial information by first using a 1x1 convolution and then a 5x5 
  convolution; the fourth branch first performs a 3x3 max pooling for downsampling, 
  followed by a 1x1 convolution for further processing. Finally, the outputs of these 
  branches are concatenated together. After flattening the features, the model uses two 
  fully connected layers to combine the features and complete a 10-class classification task."
