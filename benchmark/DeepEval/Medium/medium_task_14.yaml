Requirement: "Please assist me in creating a deep learning model for image classification
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model will include three sequential blocks, each 
  comprising a convolutional layer, a batch normalization layer, and a ReLU activation 
  function to extract image features. These blocks will produce three separate output paths,
  each corresponding to one block's output. Additionally, a parallel branch of convolutional 
  layers will process the input directly. The outputs from all paths will be added, and the 
  aggregated result will pass through two fully connected layers for classification."
