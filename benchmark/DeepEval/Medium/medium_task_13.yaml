Requirement: "Please help me create a deep learning model for image classification
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model will include three convolutional layers, where
  the output from each layer is concatenated with the input of the previous layer
  along the channel dimension for the next layer. Finally,the output will be flattened
  and passed through two fully connected layers to produce classification probabilities,
  making the model suitable for multi-class classification tasks."
