Requirement: "Please assist me in developing a deep learning model for image classification
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model features a multi-branch architecture where the input
  is processed through four distinct branches for feature extraction. These branches include:
  1. 1x1 convolution 2. 1x1 convolution followed by 3x3 convolution 3. 1x1 convolution followed
  by two consecutive 3x3 convolutions 4. Average pooling followed by 1x1 convolution To mitigate
  overfitting, dropout layers are applied at each branch. The outputs from all branches are concatenated
  before being passed through three fully connected layers for classification."
