Requirement: "Please help me create a deep learning model for image classification 
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset.The model begins by processing the input through a 
  initial convolutional layer. It then extracts features along the channel dimension 
  using two parallel paths: one with global average pooling followed by two fully 
  connected layers, and the other with global max pooling followed by two fully connected
  layers. The outputs from these two paths are added and passed through an activation 
  function to generate channel attention weights, which are then applied to the original
  features via element-wise multiplication. Next, the processed features undergo separate
  average and max pooling operations to extract spatial features, which are concatenated 
  along the channel dimension to form a fused feature map. Finally,the spatial features are
  combined with the channel features through element-wise multiplication, flattened, and 
  fed into a fully connected layer to produce the final output."
