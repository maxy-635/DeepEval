Requirement: "Please help me generate a deep learning model for image classification. 
  The input data set is: CIFAR-10.The model begins by spiltting the input into three 
  groups along the last dimension, utilizing a Lambda layer to encapsulate the tf.split
  operation. Each group then undergoes feature extraction via depthwise separable 
  convolutional layers, employing distinct kernel sizes of 1x1, 3x3, and 5x5, respectively.
  The outputs of the three groups are then concatenated and fused together.Finally, the
  fused features are flattened into a one-dimensional vector and passed through a fully 
  connected layer for classification."
