Requirement: "Please assist me in creating a deep learning model for image classification
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model includes a main path and a branch path. The main 
  path features two blocks of convolution followed by max pooling, while the branch path 
  consists of one block of convolution and max pooling. The outputs from both paths are 
  combined using an addition operation. Finally,the combined output is flattened into a 
  one-dimensional vector by a flattening layer, and the features are projected onto a 
  probability distribution across 10 classes using two fully connected layers."
