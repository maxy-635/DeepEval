Requirement: "Please assist me in creating a deep learning model for image classification
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model begins by splitting the input into three groups 
  along the channel dimension by encapsulating tf.split within Lambda layer and applying
  1x1 convolutions to each group independently. The number of convolutional kernels for 
  each group is set to one-third of the input channels. After this, each group undergoes
  downsampling via an average pooling layer with consistent parameters.The three resulting
  groups of feature maps are then concatenated along the channel dimension. Finally, the 
  concatenated feature maps are flattened into a one-dimensional vector and passed through
  two fully connected layers for classification."
