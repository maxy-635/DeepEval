Requirement: "Please assist me in creating a deep learning model for image classification 
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model begins with a convolutional layer, followed by 
  batch normalization and ReLU activation, to extract initial features. Next,it compresses
  these feature maps using global average pooling and two fully connected layers, adjusting
  their dimensions to be same as the channels of the initial features. The output is then 
  reshaped to match the size of the initial feature and multiplied with the initial features
  to generate weighted feature maps, which are subsequently concatenated with the input layer.
  Finally, the model reduces dimensionality and downsamples the feature using 1x1 convolution
  and average pooling, culminating in a single fully connected layer that outputs the classification
  results."
