Requirement: "Please assist me in creating a deep learning model for image classification
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model will begin with two convolutional layers followed
  by a max-pooling layer to extract features. The output features will be directly added 
  with the input layer. Finally, these features will be flattened and processed through two
  fully connected layers to produce a probability distribution across the 10 classes."
