Requirement: "Please assist me in creating a deep learning model for image classification
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model will consist of three average pooling layers with
  pooling windows and strides of 1x1,2x2, and 4x4, allowing it to capture spatial information
  at different scales. The outputs of these pooling layers will be flattened into one-dimensional
  vectors and concatenated. After concatenation, the fused features will be further flattened
  and processed through two fully connected layers to generate the final classification results."
