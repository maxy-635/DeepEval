Requirement: "Please assist me in generating a deep learning model for image classification
  using the MNIST dataset. The model consists of two sequential blocks, each comprising a 
  convolutional layer followed by a max pooling layer, which extracts deep features from 
  the input. Note that the last convolution output dimension needs to be the same as the 
  channel dimension of the input image. The outputs from both paths are then combined with
  the input through an addition operation, creating a comprehensive feature representation.
  Finally, a fully connected layer classifies the output, providing a probability distribution
  across ten categories."
