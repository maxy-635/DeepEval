Requirement: "Please assist me in creating a deep learning model for image classification
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model will consist of two main components: a main path
  and a branch path.In the main path, the input is splitted into three groups along the 
  last dimension by encapsulating tf.split within Lambda layer.The first group remains 
  unchanged, while the second group undergoes feature extraction via a 3x3 convolutional 
  layer. The output of the second group is then combined with the third group before passing
  through an additional 3x3 convolution. Finally, the outputs of all three groups are 
  concatenated to form the output of the main path.The branch path employs a 1x1 convolutional
  layer to process the input. The outputs from both the main and branch paths are fused 
  together through addition.The final classification result is obtained by flattening the 
  combined output and passing it through a fully connected layer."
