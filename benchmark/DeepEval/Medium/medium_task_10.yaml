Requirement: "Please assist me in creating a deep learning model for image classification 
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset.The model begins by adjusting the input feature dimensionality 
  to 16 using a convolutional layer. It employs a basic block where the main path includes
  convolution, batch normalization, and ReLU activation, while the branch connects directly 
  to the block's input. The outputs from both paths are combined through an addition operation.
  The core architecture of the model utilizes these basic blocks to create a three-level 
  residual connection structure. The first level consists of the above basic block. The second
  level comprises two residual blocks; each has a main path formed by the above basic block
  and a branch that extracts features via an independent convolutional layer. The outputs 
  from the main path and branch are added to generate the final output for this level. The 
  third level captures features from the initial convolution output using a convolutional 
  layer in the global branch. This output is then added to the result of the second-level 
  residual structure, enhancing feature fusion and expressiveness. Finally, average pooling
  followed by a fully connected layer maps the features to classification probabilities across 
  10 classes, making it suitable for multi-class classification tasks."
