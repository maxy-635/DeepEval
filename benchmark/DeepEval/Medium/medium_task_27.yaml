Requirement: "Please help me create a deep learning model for image classification 
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model features two parallel convolutional
  branches with convolutional kernels of varying sizes (3x3 and 5x5 respectively)
  to extract features, which are combined through addition. Following this, a global
  average pooling layer compresses the features, leading into two fully connected
  layers that apply a softmax function to generate attention weights. The output of
  each branch is multiplied by its corresponding weight and added to produce the final
  weighted output. Lastly, a fully connected layer delivers the probability distribution
  across the 10 classes."
