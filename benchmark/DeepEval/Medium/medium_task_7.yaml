Requirement: "Please assist me in creating a deep learning model for image classification
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model consists of three sequential convolutional layers,
  each processing the output of the previous layer. The outputs of the first two convolutional
  layers are added with the output of the third convolutional layer. Simultaneously, a separate
  convolutional layer processes the input directly. The added outputs from all paths are then
  passed through two fully connected layers for classification."
