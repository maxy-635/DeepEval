Requirement: "Please help me create a deep learning model for image classification 
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model will extract features at multiple scales 
  using various convolution and pooling operations, including 1x1, 3x3, and 5x5 
  convolutions, as well as 3x3 max pooling. These features will be combined through
  concatenation. Finally, the model will output classification results via a flattening
  layer followed by two fully connected layers."
