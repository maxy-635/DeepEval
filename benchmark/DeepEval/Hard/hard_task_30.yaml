Requirement: "I would like assistance in creating a deep learning model for image 
  classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model comprises two blocks.
  The first block features a dual-path structure: the main path and a branch path.
  The main path starts with two convolutional layers to increase the feature map width,
  followed by another convolutional to restore the number of channels to match that
  of the input layer. The branch path directly connects to the input. Both paths are
  then combined through addition to produce the final output. The second block splits
  the input into three groups along the channel by encapsulating tf.split within Lambda
  layer. Each group extracts features using depthwise separable convolutional layers
  with different kernel sizes: 1x1, 3x3, and 5x5. The outputs from these three groups
  are concatenated. After establishing the input layer, the model processes features
  through the two blocks and concludes with two fully connected layers that generate
  classification probabilities."
