Requirement: "Please help me generate a deep learning model for image classification. 
  The input data set is: MNIST. The model consists of two specific blocks. Block 1 
  contains three parallel paths, each passing through max pooling layers of three 
  different scales (with pooling windows and strides of 1x1,2x2, and 4x4, respectively).
  The pooling results from each path are then flattened into one-dimensional
  vectors and regularized using dropout layers. These vectors are concatenated to
  form the output.Between block 1 and block 2, a fully connected layer and reshaping
  operation are used to transform the output of block 1 into a 4-dimensional tensor
  format suitable for processing by block 2. Block 2 starts with four parallel paths
  from the same input layer, each employing different convolution and pooling strategies
  to extract multi-scale features. Path 1 uses a single 1x1 convolution, Path 2 employs
  a 1x1 convolution followed by a 1x7 convolution and a 7x1 convolution to deeply
  explore features, Path 3 uses a 1x1 convolution followed by two alternating 7x1
  and 1x7 convolutions for more complex feature extraction, and Path 4 combines average
  pooling with a 1x1 convolution to compress and extract features. The outputs of
  all paths are concatenated along the channel dimension. After the above processing,
  the final classification results are output through two fully connected layers."
