Requirement: "Please help me create a deep learning model for image classification 
  using the MNIST dataset. The model features two pathways for processing
  features. In the main pathway, we utilize a specialized block that includes the
  following sequence: the input data first passes through a 3x3 convolutional to extract
  spatial features, followed by two 1x1 convolutional for integrating inter-channel
  information. A max pooling is then applied to reduce the size of the feature maps,
  and a 50% dropout layer is included to mitigate overfitting. The branch pathway
  consists of a convolutional layer that matches the size of the output feature maps
  from the main pathway. The outputs from both pathways are fused using an addition
  operation. Finally, the model concludes with a global average pooling layer, a flattening
  layer, and a fully connectedlayer to produce the classification results."
