Requirement: "Please assist me in creating a deep learning model for image classification
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model consists of a main path and a branch path. In the
  main path,the input features undergo global average pooling to extract global information
  from the feature map. The pooled features are then passed through two fully connected 
  layers to generate weights with the same number of channels as the input layer. These weights
  are reshaped to match the input layer's shape and multiplied element-wise with the input 
  feature map.The branch path is directly connected to the input layer without any modification.
  The outputs from both the main and branch paths are added together.The combined result is 
  then fed through two fully connected layers to produce the final probability distribution."
