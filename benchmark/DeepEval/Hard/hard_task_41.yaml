Requirement: "Please help me generate a deep learning model for image classification. 
  The input data set is: MNIST. The model consists of two special blocks. Block 1 
  contains three parallel paths, each passing through average pooling layers of three 
  different scales (with pooling windows and strides of 1x1,2x2, and 4x4, respectively).
  Each pooling result is then flattened into a one-dimensional vector and regularized 
  using a dropout operation. These vectors are concatenated and fused to form the output.
  Between block 1 and block 2, a fully connected layer and reshaping operation are used 
  to transform the output of block 1 into a 4-dimensional tensor format suitable for 
  processing by block 2. Block 2 includes multiple branch connections: the input is 
  separately passed through four branches for feature extraction: 1x1 convolution, 
  <1x1 convolution, 3x3 convolution>,<1x1 convolution, 3x3 convolution,3x3 convolution>,
  and <average pooling, 1x1 convolution>.The outputs of these branches are concatenated 
  and fused to form the output.After the above processing, the final classification result
  is output through two fully connected layers."
