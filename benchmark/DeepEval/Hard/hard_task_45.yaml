Requirement: "Please assist me in creating a deep learning model for image classification
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model comprises two blocks. The first block spiltted
  the input into three groups along the last dimension by encapsulating tf.split within 
  Lambda layer, each employing depthwise separable convolutional layers with varying kernel
  sizes (1x1, 3x3, and 5x5) to extract features. The outputs from these groups are then 
  concatenated. The second block features multiple branches for feature extraction. Each 
  branch processes the input separately using different configurations: 1x1 convolution, 
  <1x1 convolution,3x3 convolution, 3x3 convolution>, <1x1 convolution, 3x3 convolution>,
  and <max pooling, 1x1 convolution>. The outputs from all branches are concatenated for 
  fusion. Finally, after feature extraction in both blocks, the model outputs the result 
  via a flattening layer followed by a fully connected layer."
