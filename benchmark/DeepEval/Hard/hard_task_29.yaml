Requirement: "Please assist me in creating a deep learning model for image classification
  using the MNIST dataset. The model is structured into two blocks: The first block features
  both a main path and a branch path. The main path begins with a convolutional layer that
  increases the feature map's dimensions, followed by another convolutional layer that 
  restores the number of channels. The branch path connects directly to the input. The outputs
  from both paths are combined through addition to produce the final output of this block. 
  The second employs three max pooling layers with varying scales (pooling windows and strides
  of 1x1, 2x2, and 4x4, respectively). The results from these pooling layers are flattened 
  into one-dimensional vectors, which are then concatenated to form the output for this block.
  After processing through both blocks, the model passes through two fully connected layers 
  to produce the final classification result."
