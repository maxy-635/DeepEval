Requirement: "I would like assistance in developing a deep learning model for image 
  classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model begins with a 1x1 initial 
  convolutional, followed by three distinct branches: The first branch focuses on 
  local feature extraction, consisting of two sequential 3x3 convolutional layers. 
  The second and third branches both first undergo average pooling for downsampling,
  reducing the feature map size by half.They then pass through a 3x3 convolutional
  layer, followed by a transposed convolutional layer for upsampling, which restores
  the feature maps to their original dimensions. After processing through their respective
  branches, the outputs are concatenated and refined using a 1x1 convolutional layer.
  Finally, the consolidated output is fed into a fully connected layer to produce
  a classification result across 10 classes."
