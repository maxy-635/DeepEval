Requirement: "Please assist me in creating a deep learning model for image classification
  using the MNIST dataset. The model comprises two specialized blocks. The first block 
  processes the input through three max pooling layers with varying scales, using pooling
  windows and strides of 1x1, 2x2, and 4x4, respectively.Each pooling result is flattened
  into a one-dimensional vector and then concatenated. Between Block 1 and Block 2, a 
  fully connected layer and a reshape operation convert the output of Block 1 into a 
  4-dimensional tensor suitable for Block 2.The second block features multiple branches:
  the input is processed separately through 1x1 convolution,3x3 convolution, 5x5 convolution,
  and 3x3 max pooling to extract features. The outputs from all branches are then concatenated
  to form the output. Finally,the classification result is generated through a flattening 
  layer followed by a fully connected layer."
