Requirement: "Please assist me in creating a deep learning model for image classification
  using the MNIST dataset. The model features three branches, each built from a specialized
  block. This block begins with a depthwise separable convolutional layer, followed by a 
  1x1 convolutional layer to extract features. To mitigate overfitting, dropout layers are 
  applied after both convolutional layers. The outputs from the three branches are concatenated
  and then processed through two fully connected layers to generate the final classification results."
