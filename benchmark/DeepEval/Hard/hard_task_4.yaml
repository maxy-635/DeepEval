Requirement: "I need assistance in creating a deep learning model for image classification
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model begins by increasing the dimensionality of the 
  input's channels threefold with a 1x1 convolution and extracts initial features using a
  3x3 depthwise separable convolution. The model then computes channel attention weights 
  through global average pooling followed by two fully connected layers, generating weights
  whose size is same as the channels of the initial features.The weights are then reshaped 
  to match the initial features and multiplied with the initial features to achieve achieve
  channel attention weighting.Finally, a 1x1 convolution reduces the dimensionality, and the
  output is combined with the initial input. The resulting output is passed through a flattening
  layer and a fully connected layer to complete the classification process."
