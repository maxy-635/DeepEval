Requirement: "Please assist me in creating a deep learning model for image classification
  using the MNIST dataset. The model features two processing pathways,each employing a 
  repeated block structure executed three times. The block includes batch normalization 
  and ReLU activation, followed by a 3x3 convolutional layer that extracts features 
  while preserving spatial dimensions. The original input of the block is then concatenated
  with the new features along the channel dimension. The outputs from both pathways are merged
  through concatenation and classified using two fully connected layers."
