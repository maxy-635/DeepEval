Requirement: "Please assist me in developing a deep learning model for image classification
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model consists of two main blocks: the first block processes
  the input through four parallel branches: a 1x1 convolution, a 3x3 convolution, a 5x5 
  convolution,and a 3x3 max pooling operation. These branches are designed to extract diverse
  features from the input, and their outputs are concatenated to form a unified feature 
  representation. The second block tasks the first block's output as input and it reduces the 
  dimensionality of the feature maps using global average pooling. The pooled features are 
  then passed through two fully connected layers, generating weights whose size is the same 
  as the channels of block 2's input. These weights are then reshaped to match the input's 
  shape and multiplied element-wise with the input feature map. The resulting feature map is
  then processed by a final fully connected layer to produce the output probability distribution."
