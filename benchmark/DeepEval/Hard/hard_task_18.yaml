Requirement: "Please assist me in creating a deep learning model for image classification 
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model comprises two sequential blocks. The first block 
  extracts features through two 3x3 convolutional layers,followed by an average pooling 
  layer for smoothing. The input to the first block is combined with the output of the 
  main path via addition.In the second block,the main path compresses the feature map 
  using global average pooling to generate channel weights, which are then refined through
  two fully connected layers with the same number of channels as the output of first block.
  After reshaping, these weights are multiplied by the input. Finally, the flattened output 
  is passed through another fully connected layer for classification."
