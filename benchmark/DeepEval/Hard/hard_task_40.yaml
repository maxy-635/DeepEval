Requirement: "Please assist me in creating a deep learning model for image classification
  using the MNIST dataset. The model comprises two specialized blocks.The first block 
  processes the input through three average pooling layers with pooling windows and 
  strides of 1x1, 2x2, and 4x4, respectively. The outputs from these pooling layers 
  are flattened into one-dimensional vectors and concatenated to create a vector. A 
  fully connected layer, followed by a reshape operation, converts this output into 
  a 4-dimensional tensor suitable for the second block. The second block consists of 
  four parallel paths, each designed to extract multi-scale features using different 
  convolutional kernels. Path 1 employs a 1x1 convolution for quick feature extraction.
  Path 2 features two 3x3 convolutions stacked after a 1x1 convolution. Path 3 includes
  a single 3x3 convolution following a 1x1 convolution. While Path 4 combines average 
  pooling with a 1x1 convolution for feature compression and extraction. Each path ends
  with a dropout layer to mitigate overfitting. The outputs from all paths are then 
  concatenated along the channel dimension. Finally, the model outputs the classification
  result through two fully connected layers."
