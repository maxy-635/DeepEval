Requirement: "Please help me create a deep learning model for image classification
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model consists of a main path splitted into four
  blocks: Block 1, Block 2,Block 3, and Block 1 again. In Block 1, the input is splitted
  into three groups by encapsulating tf.split within Lambda layer,each processed by
  a 1x1 convolutional layer that reduces the number of output channels to one-third
  of the original. The output from these three groups are then concatenated along
  the channel dimension to generate fused features. Block 2 starts by obtaining the
  shape of the feature from Block 1, and then reshapes it into three groups,with a
  target shape of (height, width, groups, channels_per_group), where groups=3 and
  channels_per_group=channels/groups. Then it swaps the third and fourth dimensions
  using permutation operations, before reshaping the feature back to its original
  shape to achieve channel shuffling.In Block 3, the output from Block 2 is processed
  using a 3x3 depthwise separable convolution. Additionally, there is a branch in
  the model that connects directly to the input.The outputs from the main path and
  the branch are combined through an addition operation,after which the final output
  is passed through a fully connected layer to complete the classification task."
