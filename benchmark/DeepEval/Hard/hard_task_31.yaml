Requirement: "Please assist me in creating a deep learning model for image classification
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model consists of two main blocks. The first block features
  both a main path and a branch path. The main path begins with a <convolution, dropout> block
  to expand the width of the feature map, followed by a convolutional layer to restore the 
  number of channels to same as those of input.In parallel, the branch path directly connects
  to the input. The outputs from both paths are then added to produce the output of this block.
  The second block split the input into three groups along the last dimension by encapsulating
  tf.split within Lambda layer, with each group using separable convolutional layers of varying
  kernel sizes (1x1, 3x3, and 5x5) to extract features. Each convolution is followed by a dropout
  layer to mitigate overfitting. The outputs from the three groups are concatenated to create a 
  unified feature representation. After processing through these two blocks to extract features, 
  the model outputs the final predictions via a flattening layer and a fully connected layer."
