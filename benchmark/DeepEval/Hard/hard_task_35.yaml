Requirement: "I'd like assistance in generating a deep learning model for image 
  classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model features two branches,
  each incorporating a same block. The block first applies global average pooling
  to compress the input features and then passes the pooled output through two fully
  connected layers to produce weights whose dimension is equal to the channel of input.
  These weights are reshaped to match the input's shape and are then element-wise
  multiplied with the block's input. The outputs from both branches are concatenated,
  followed by a flattening layer and a fully connected layer, which ultimately yields
  the classification results."
