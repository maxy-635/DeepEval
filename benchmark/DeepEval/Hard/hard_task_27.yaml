Requirement: "Please assist me in creating a deep learning model for image classification
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model will begin by extracting spatial features with a
  7x7 depthwise separable convolutional layer, incorporating layer normalization to 
  enhance training stability. It will then pass through two fully connected layers with 
  the same numbers of channel as the input layer for channel-wise feature transformation.
  Finally, the model will combine the original input with the processed features through
  an addition operation. The output will classify the images into 10 categories using the 
  final two fully connected layers."
