Requirement: "I need assistance in creating a deep learning model for image classification
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model begins by splitting the input into three groups 
  along the channel dimension by encapsulating tf.split within Lambda layer. Each group 
  undergoes a sequence of <1x1 convolution,3x3 convolution> to extract deep features, 
  followed by a dropout layer for feature selection to mitigate overfitting. The outputs
  from the three groups are then concatenated to form the main pathway. In parallel, a 
  branch pathway processes the input through a 1x1 convolution to match the output dimension
  of the main pathway. The outputs from both pathways are combined using an addition operation.
  Finally, the resulting output is passed through a fully connected layer to complete the 
  classification process."
