Requirement: "I need assistance in creating a deep learning model for image classification
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model consists of two sequential blocks. In Block 1, 
  global average pooling generates weights that pass through two fully connected layers 
  with the same channel as the input layer. These weights are reshaped to match the input's
  shape and multiplied with the input to produce the weighted feature output. Block 2 
  extracts deep features using two 3x3 convolutional layers followed by a max pooling layer.
  A branch from Block 1 connects directly to the output of Block 2. The outputs from the main
  path and the branch are then fused through addition.Finally, the combined output is classified
  using two fully connected layers."
