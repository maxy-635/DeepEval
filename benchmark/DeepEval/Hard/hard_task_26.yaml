Requirement: "Please assist me in creating a deep learning model for image classification
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model consists of a main path and a branch path. In the 
  main path, the input features are first processed by a 1x1 initial convolutional, which 
  then branches into three distinct paths. Branch 1 applies a 3x3 convolutional layer for 
  feature extraction. Meanwhile, Branches 2 and 3 downsample the feature maps using max 
  pooling layers, apply 3x3 convolutional layers, and subsequently upsample the feature 
  maps back to their original size. The outputs from all branches are concatenated and 
  passed through another 1x1 convolutional layer to produce the final output of the main 
  path. The branch path also begins with a 1x1 convolutional layer, ensuring that the 
  number of channels matches that of the main path. The outputs from both paths are then 
  added and processed through two fully connected layers to perform classification across 
  10 classes."
