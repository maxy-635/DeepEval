Requirement: "Please assist me in generating a deep learning model for image classification
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model consists of two blocks. In block 1, the input is 
  first splitted into three groups along the channel by encapsulating tf.split within Lambda
  layer, each undergoing feature extraction through convolutional with varying kernel sizes 
  (1x1, 3x3, and 5x5). A dropout layer is then applied to reduce overfitting, followed by 
  concatenation of the outputs from the three groups. The second block features four branches
  that process the input separately. The branches consist of: 1x1 convolution, <1x1 convolution,
  3x3 convolution>, <1x1 convolution,5x5 convolution>, <3x3 max pooling, 1x1 convolution>. The
  outputs from all branches are concatenated for feature fusion. Finally, the model outputs 
  the result through a flattening layer followed by a fully connected layer."
