Requirement: "Please assist me in developing a deep learning model for image classification
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model consists of the following sequential components: 
  Block 1, a Transition Convolution,and Block 2. In block 1, the input is splitted into 
  three groups along the last dimension by encapsulating tf.split within Lambda layer, 
  each responsible for extracting deep features through a series of convolutions: a 1x1 
  convolution,followed by a 3x3 convolution, and concluding with another 1x1 convolution. 
  The outputs from these three groups are then concatenated. Next, the transition convolution
  layer adjusts the number of channels to match the input layer. Block 2 follows, performing
  global max pooling on the adjusted output. It then generates channel-matching weights through
  two fully connected layers, generating weights whose size is the same as the channels of 
  the input. Block 2 then reshapes these weights to match the shape of adjusted output, and 
  multiplies them with the adjusted output to produce the main path output. Additionally, 
  a branch of the model connects directly to the input. The outputs from both the main path
  and the branch are added together, and the final output is fed through a fully connected layer
  for classification."
