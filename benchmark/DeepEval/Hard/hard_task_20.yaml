Requirement: "Please help me create a deep learning model for image classification
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model consists of a main path and a branch path.
  The main path splits the input into three groups by encapsulating tf.split within
  Lambda layer, each undergoing feature extraction with convolutional layers of different
  kernel sizes (1x1, 3x3, and 5x5). The outputs from these three groups are then concatenated.
  The branch path processes the input with a 1x1 convolutional layer to align the
  number of output channels with those of the main path. The outputs of the main and
  branch paths are combined through addition to create fused features. Finally, the
  model performs classification using two fully connected layers."
