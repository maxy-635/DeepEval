Requirement: "I need assistance in creating a deep learning model for image classification
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model comprises two main blocks. In the first block, 
  the input is splitted into three groups along the channel by encapsulating tf.split 
  within Lambda layer, each group uses separable convolutional with different kernel sizes
  (1x1, 3x3, and 5x5) to extract features. The outputs from these three groups are then 
  concatenated. In the second block, the block features multiple branches for enhanced 
  feature extraction. The input is processed through: 1.a 3x3 convolution, 2.a series 
  of layers consisting of a 1x1 convolution followed by two 3x3 convolutions, 3.a max pooling
  branch. After feature extraction, the outputs from all branches are concatenated for 
  further integration. After processing through both blocks, the concatenated outputs 
  undergo global average pooling, followed by a fully connected layer that produces the 
  final classification results."
