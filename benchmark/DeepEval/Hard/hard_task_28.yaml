Requirement: "Please help me create a deep learning model for image classification 
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model will consist of a main path and a branch path. 
  The main path begins with a 7x7 depthwise convolution to extract features, followed 
  by layer normalization for standardization. Next, it includes two sequential 1x1 
  pointwise convolution layers with the same numbers of channel as the input layer 
  to refine the feature representation. The branch path connects directly to the input.
  The outputs of both paths are then combined through an addition operation. Finally, 
  the combined output is flattened into a one-dimensional vector and processed through
  two fully connected layers for classification."
