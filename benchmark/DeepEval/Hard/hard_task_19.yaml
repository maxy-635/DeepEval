Requirement: "Please help me create a deep learning model for image classification 
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model consists of two main components: the main path
  and the branch path.In the main path,the model sequentially extracts features through
  three 3x3 convolutional layers,followed by a max pooling layer. The second path includes
  a global average pooling layer and two fully connected layers that generate channel weights.
  These weights are reshaped and multiplied with the input. Finally,the outputs from both
  paths are added and passed through two additional fully connected layers for classification."
