Requirement: "Please assist me in creating a deep learning model for image classification 
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model consists of a main path and a branch path. In the
  main path, the input is splitted into three groups along the channel by encapsulating 
  tf.split within Lambda layer, each undergoing multi-scale feature extraction with 
  separable convolutional layers of varying kernel sizes (1x1, 3x3, and 5x5). The outputs 
  from these groups are concatenated to produce the output of the main path. The branch 
  path applies a 1x1 convolutional layer to the input to align the number of output channels
  with those of the main path. The outputs from both paths are then fused through addition.
  Finally, the combined output is flattened into a one-dimensional vector and passed through 
  two fully connected layers for a 10-class classification task."
