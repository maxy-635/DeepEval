Requirement: "Please assist me in creating a deep learning model for image classification
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The main path of the model consists of four components: 
  Block 1, Block 2, Block 3, and Block 1 (repeated). Additionally, a branch path extracts
  features from the original input using an average pooling layer. The outputs from both
  the main path and the branch path are then concatenated. Finally, the combined output 
  is passed through a fully connected layer to complete the classification process. The 
  detailed of blocks are as follows: In Block 1, the input is splitted into three groups 
  by encapsulating tf.split within Lambda layer, each processed by a 1x1 convolutional 
  layer followed by an activation function. This reduces the number of output channels 
  to one-third of the original count. The outputs from these three groups are concatenated
  to produce the fused features of Block 1. Block 2 starts by obtaining the shape of the 
  features from Block 1 and then reshapes the feature into a target shape of (height, width,
  groups, channels_per_group),where groups=3. Then it swaps the third and fourth dimensions 
  using permutation operations, before reshaping the feature back to its original shape to 
  achieve channel shuffling. Block 3 applies a 3x3 depthwise separable convolution to the 
  output from Block 2."
