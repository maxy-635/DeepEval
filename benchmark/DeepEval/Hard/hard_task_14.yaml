Requirement: "Please assist me in creating a deep learning model for image classification 
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model comprises a main path and a branch path. In the 
  main path, the input features undergo global average pooling to extract global information
  from the feature map.The pooled output is then processed through two fully connected layers
  to generate weights whose size is same as the channels of input layer. These weights are 
  reshaped to match the input layer's shape and multiplied element-wise with the original 
  feature map.In the branch path, this path connects to the input layer via a 3x3 convolution,
  adjusting the output feature map's channel to match that of the input layer. The outputs 
  from both paths are added together. Finally, the combined result is passed through three 
  fully connected layers to produce the final probability distribution for classification."
