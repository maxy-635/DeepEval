Requirement: "Please assist me in creating a deep learning model for image classification
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model will first splits the input into three groups along 
  the channel dimension by encapsulating tf.split within Lambda layer.Each group will 
  sequentially pass through a series of convolutions: a 1x1 convolution, followed by a 3x3 
  convolution, and another 1x1 convolution to extract features. The outputs from these 
  three groups will be combined using an addition operation to form the main path. Next, 
  the main path will be fused with the original input layer through another addition. 
  Finally, the combined features will be flattened into a one-dimensional vector, which 
  will be fed into a fully connected layer for classification."
