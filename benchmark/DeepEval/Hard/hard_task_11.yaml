Requirement: "I need assistance in creating a deep learning model for image classification
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset.The main pathway of the model extracts features through a 
  combination of a 1x1 convolution and another parallel branch that includes 1x1, 1x3, 
  and 3x1 convolutions.The outputs from these two paths are concatenated and passed 
  through another 1x1 convolution to produce the main output with the same dimensions 
  as the channel of input. Additionally, a direct connection from the input to the model's
  branch allows for fusion with the main pathway via an additive operation. Finally, the 
  classification probabilities are generated through two fully connected layers."
