Requirement: "Please assist me in creating a deep learning model for image classification
  using MNIST dataset. The model features two parallel branches, each consisting of a 
  same block. The block contains three sequential convolutional layers, with the outputs
  of each layer directed to separate main paths. Additionally, a parallel branch connects
  the input through a convolutional layer. The outputs from all paths are combined using 
  an addition operation. Subsequently, the outputs from the two blocks are concatenated.
  After passing through a flattening layer and a fully connected layer, the model produces
  the final classification results."
