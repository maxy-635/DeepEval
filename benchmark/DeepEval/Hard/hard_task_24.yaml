Requirement: "Please help me generate a deep learning model for image classification. 
  The input data set is: CIFAR-10. The model first passes the input through a 1x1 initial
  convolutional layer, then through three separate branches. Branch 1 extracts local features
  through a 3x3 convolutional layer. The second and third branches both sequentially pass
  through a max pooling layer for downsampling, reducing the feature map size, followed by 
  a 3x3 convolutional layer, and then an upsampling layer to restore to the original size.
  Subsequently, the outputs of all branches are fused together through concatenation and 
  passed through another 1x1 convolutional layer. Finally, the output is passed through 
  three fully connected layers to produce a 10-class classification result."
