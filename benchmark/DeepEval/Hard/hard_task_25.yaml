Requirement: "Please help me generate a deep learning model for image classification. 
  The input data set is: CIFAR-10. The structure of this model includes a main path 
  and a branch path: The main path first processes the input through a 1x1 convolutional
  layer, then splits into three branches. The first branch extracts local features through
  a 3x3 convolutional layer, while the second and third branches downsample the input 
  through average pooling layers, process the downsampled data through 3x3 convolutional
  layers, and then upsample it through transpose convolutional layers. Next, the outputs
  of all branches are concatenated, and a 1x1 convolutional layer is applied to form the
  main path output. The branch path processes the input through a 1x1 convolutional layer
  to match the number of channels of the main path. Finally, the main path and branch path 
  outputs are fused together through addition. The final output is completed through a fully 
  connected layer for 10-class classification."
