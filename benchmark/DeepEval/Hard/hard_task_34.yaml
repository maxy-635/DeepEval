Requirement: "Please help me generate a deep learning model for image classification. 
  The input data set is: MNIST. The model consists of two pathways to process features.
  The main path includes a specific block that, upon receiving the current input, 
  extracts and enhances features through a ReLU activation function and a separable 
  convolutional layer. Subsequently, the block input is concatenated with the convolved
  feature map along the channel dimension. The main path repeats this block three times
  in sequence. The branch path employs a convolutional layer that maintains the same 
  channels as the main_path''s output. The two paths fuse their features through an 
  addition operation, and finally, the flattened features are passed through a fully
  connected layer to output the classification results."
