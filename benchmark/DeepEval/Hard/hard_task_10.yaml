Requirement: "I need assistance in creating a deep learning model for image classification
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model will have two feature extraction paths: 1. One path
  employs a 1x1 convolution. 2. The second path consists of a sequence of convolutions: 1x1,
  followed by 1x7,and then 7x1. The outputs from these two paths will be concatenated, and 
  a 1x1 convolution will be applied to align the output dimensions with the input image's 
  channel, creating the output for the main path. Additionally,a branch will connect directly
  to the input, merging the outputs of the main path and the branch through addition. Finally,
  the classification results will be produced through two fully connected layers."
