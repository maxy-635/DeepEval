Requirement: "Please help me create a deep learning model for image classification
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model consists of two blocks. The first block processes
  the input through three max pooling layers with different scales, utilizing pooling
  windows and strides of 1x1, 2x2, and 4x4, respectively. Each pooling output is flattened
  into a one-dimensional vector. To mitigate overfitting, dropout is applied before
  concatenating these vectors. A fully connected layer and a reshape operation transform
  the output of the first block into a four-dimensional tensor for processing in second
  block. The second block spilts the input into four groups along the last dimension
  by encapsulating tf.split within Lambda layer.Each group is processed by a separable
  convolutional with varying kernel sizes (1x1, 3x3, 5x5, and 7x7) to extract features.
  The outputs from these four groups are concatenated. Finally, the model produces
  the classification result by flattening the output and passing it through a fully
  connected layer."
