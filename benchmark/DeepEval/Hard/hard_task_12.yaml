Requirement: "Please assist me in creating a deep learning model for image classification. 
  The shape of input data is (32, 32, 64). The model consists of a main path and a branch 
  path. In the main path, the input first undergoes a 1x1 convolutional for dimensionality
  reduction, followed by two parallel convolutional layers with 1x1 and 3x3 kernels for 
  feature extraction. The outputs of these two layers are then concatenated. In the branch 
  path, the input is processed by a 3x3 convolutional layer to ensure that its output dimensions
  match the main path's channel.The outputs from the main and branch paths are combined using
  addition. Finally, the model produces classification probabilities through a flattening layer
  followed by two fully connected layers."
