Requirement: "Please assist me in creating a deep learning model for image classification
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model''s main path consists of three feature extraction 
  branches: 1. A branch with a 1x1 convolution. 2. A branch with a 1x1 convolution followed
  by a 3x3 convolution. 3. A branch with a 1x1 convolution followed by two 3x3 convolutions.
  The outputs from these three branches are concatenated, followed by a 1x1 convolution to 
  adjust the output dimensions to match the input image's channel size. Meanwhile, the branch
  directly connects to the input, and the main path and the branch are fused together through
  addition. Finally, the classification result is output through three fully connected layers."
