Requirement: "Please help me create a deep learning model for image classification 
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model consists of two main blocks. The first block
  splits the input into three groups along the last dimension by encapsulating tf.split
  within Lambda layer, each utilizing depthwise separable convolutional layers with 
  different kernel sizes (1x1, 3x3, 5x5) for feature extraction. Batch normalization
  is applied to improve performance. The outputs from these three groups are then
  concatenated.The second block contains multiple branches for feature extraction.
  The input is processed through three distinct branches using <1x1 convolution, 3x3
  convolution>, <1x1 convolution, 1x7 convolution,7x1 convolution, 3x3 convolution>,
  and average pooling. The outputs from all branches are concatenated to form the
  final output. Finally, the classification result is produced through two fully connected
  layers."
