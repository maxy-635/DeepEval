Requirement: "Please help me create a deep learning model for image classification 
  using the CIFAR-10 dataset. This model features a main path and a branch path. 
  In the main path, the input is splitted into three groups along the channel by 
  encapsulating tf.split within Lambda layer, each of which undergoes feature
  extraction via depthwise separable convolutional layers with varying kernel sizes:
  1x1, 3x3, and 5x5. The outputs from these three groups are concatenated to produce
  the main path output. The branch path employs a 1x1 convolutional layer to align
  the number of output channels with those of the main path. Finally, the outputs
  from both the main and branch paths are added. The model concludes with two fully
  connected layers for the 10-class classification task."
