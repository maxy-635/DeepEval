Requirement: "Please help me design a deep learning model for image classification using
  the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model begins with an initial convolutional layer that adjusts
  the number of output channels to match the input image channels. Block 1 features two 
  parallel processing paths: Path1: Global average pooling followed by two fully connected
  layers. Path2: Global max pooling followed by two fully connected layers. These paths both
  extract features whose size is equal to the input''s channels. The outputs from both paths 
  are added and passed through an activation function to generate channel attention weights
  matching the input's shape,which are then applied to the original features through element-wise
  multiplication. Block 2 extracts spatial features by separately applying average pooling 
  and max pooling. The outputs are concatenated along the channel dimension, followed by a 
  1x1 convolution and a sigmoid activation to normalize the features. These normalized features
  are then multiplied element-wise with the channel dimension features from Block 1. Finally, 
  an additional branch with a 1x1 convolutional layer ensures the output channels align with the
  input channels. The result is added to the main path and activated. The final classification
  is performed through a fully connected layer."
